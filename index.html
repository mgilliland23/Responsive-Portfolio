            <p class="aboutMe"> Hi! My name is Matt Gilliland. I graduated from University at Albany in 2014 with a B.S.
                in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics with a minor in Business. I took advantage of uAlbany's comined
                B.S./M.S. program and graduated the following semester with an M.S. in Computer Science. For my Master's
                project I developed the first official uAlbany App for Andriod and iOS under the guidance of the Marketing 
                Department, and with the help of another stud`ent from the University. We utilized the phonegap framework
                to create native apps for each respective platform using HTML, CSS, and Javascript source files. I was 
                mainly in charge of writing the source code and testing the app on the android platform. 
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe">After graduation, I took a freelance software development job at a company started by an
                uAlbany alumni called Northfork Web. I worked on three different projects over the course of a year and
                filled many different roles including: research and development, project manager, and lead developer. 
                When Northfork Web was no longer able to provide me work, I decided to get into the field of carpentry
                and construction.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe"> For the following two years, I honed my skills as a craftsman working for a local General 
                Contractor. I built a name for myself as someone who was meticulous, thorough, and eager to learn. 
                At the end of 2017, my best friend and I decided to go into business for ourselves and created our own 
                company: Cherry Hill Construction, LLC. Over the past two years Cherry Hill Construction has served the 
                Hudson Valley specializing in residential new home construction and renovation.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe"> After 5 years of working in a trade, I decided that I wanted to get back into the field
                of Computer Science. I am currently enrolled in the Fullstack Web Development bootcamp at Columbia University.
                It is my intention to brush up on, and learn, the skills necesarry to launch myself into a new career as a web 
                developer in the NYC area.
