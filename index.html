            <p class="aboutMe"> Hello, my name is Matt Gilliland. I graduated from University at Albany in 2014 with a B.S.
                in Computer Science & Applied Mathematics with a minor in Business.  
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe">
                I took advantage of uAlbany's comined
                B.S./M.S. program and graduated the following semester with an M.S. in Computer Science. For my Master's
                project I developed the first official uAlbany App for Andriod and iOS under the guidance of the Marketing 
                Department, and with the help of another student from the University. We utilized the phonegap framework
                to create native apps for each respective platform using HTML, CSS, and Javascript source files. I was 
                mainly in charge of writing the source code and testing the app on the android platform.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe">After graduation, I took a freelance software development job at a company started by an
                uAlbany alumni called Northfork Web. I worked on three different projects over the course of a year and
                filled many different roles including: research and development, project manager, and lead developer. 
                When Northfork Web was no longer able to provide me work, I decided to get into the field of carpentry
                and construction.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe"> For the following two years, I honed my skills as a craftsman working for a local General 
                Contractor. I built a name for myself as someone who was meticulous, thorough, and eager to learn. 
                At the end of 2017, my best friend and I decided to go into business for ourselves and created our own 
                company: Cherry Hill Construction, LLC. Over the past two years Cherry Hill Construction has served the 
                Hudson Valley specializing in residential new home construction and renovation.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMe"> After 5 years of working in a trade, I decided that I wanted to get back into the field
                of Computer Science. I am currently enrolled in the Fullstack Web Development bootcamp at Columbia University.
                It is my intention to brush up on, and learn, the skills necesarry to launch myself into a new career as a web 
                developer in the NYC area.
